# A359624 - draft

Prime numbers makes up a grid for `n` around `1.000.000`.


## Plot

For `n < 400` it's a curvy pattern.

With `n = 180.000` and 4000 points. This looks like a grid.

With `n = 300.000` and 4000 points.

With `n = 1.000.000` and 4000 points.

## Plots with lines

With `n = 180.000` and 4000 points. The grid is slightly curvy. Track the line from the top/left corner to the bottom/right corner. The points around the center is not strictly placed on the line.

With `n = 300.000` and 4000 points. The grid is still a little curvy.

With `n = 1.000.000` and 4000 points. The grid seems to be straight lines. The points seems to be placed on the lines.

## Plots of twin primes

The twin primes doesn't seem to follow a pattern.

With `n = 180.000` and 4000 points.

With `n = 180.000` and 4000 points.

With `n = 300.000` and 4000 points.
