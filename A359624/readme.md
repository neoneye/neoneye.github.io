# A359624 - draft

Prime numbers makes up a grid for `n` around `1.000.000`.


## Plot

For `n < 400` the points follows a curvy pattern.

For `n > 180.000` the points follows a grid.

## Plots with lines

For `n` around `180.000` the grid is slightly curvy. Track the line from the top/left corner to the bottom/right corner. The points around the center is not strictly placed on the line.

For `n` around `300.000` the grid is curvy and almost following straight lines.

For `n` around `1.000.000` the grid seems to straight lines. The points are placed on the lines.

## Plots of twin primes

The twin primes doesn't seem to follow a pattern.
