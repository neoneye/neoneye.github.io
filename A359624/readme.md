# A359624 - draft

Prime numbers makes up a grid for `n` around `1.000.000`.


## Plot

For `n < 400` the points follows a curvy pattern.

Here `n = 180.000` and 4000 points. This looks like a grid.

Here `n = 300.000` and 4000 points.

Here `n = 1.000.000` and 4000 points.

## Plots with lines

Here `n = 180.000` and 4000 points. The grid is slightly curvy. Track the line from the top/left corner to the bottom/right corner. The points around the center is not strictly placed on the line.

Here `n = 300.000` and 4000 points. The grid is curvy and almost following straight lines.

Here `n = 1.000.000` and 4000 points. The grid seems to straight lines. The points are placed on the lines.

## Plots of twin primes

The twin primes doesn't seem to follow a pattern.
